  skos:scopeNote "In the context of business analysis, a task refers specifically to a formally defined or informally executed unit of analytical work performed as part of the business analysis practice. Tasks in this sense are components of a structured analytical framework, such as the BABOK Guide, describing the work performed to achieve a defined analytical outcome. This use differs from the general English meaning of task, which may refer to any activity or assignment without implying alignment to business analysis processes, techniques, or deliverables."@en;
