  skos:scopeNote """Use this concept when referring to the process of assessing whether a deliverable, artifact, or requirement meets defined quality criteria, standards, or specifications.
Verification confirms that the deliverable has been produced correctly and adheres to agreed-upon methods or requirements.
It is distinct from validation, which ensures that the deliverable is fit for its intended use and meets stakeholder needs.
See also requirements verification for verification activities specific to requirements quality."""@en;
